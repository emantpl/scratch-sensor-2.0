## Welcome to Scratch Sensor 2.0 Pages

Scratch Sensor 2.0 is an Android smartphone app that allows the user to access the Android smartphone sensors in ScratchX. It is completely rewritten from Scratch Sensor 1.0 as Scratch 1.4 and Scratch 2.0 have different protocols.

### What are the requirements of Scratch Sensor 2.0?

- works **only** at [ScratchX](http://scratchx.org)
- the Android smartphone is now a webserver. So you have to enter the IP address of the smartphone in the Scratch program.
- both the smartphone and the computer running ScratchX must be on the same wifi hub
- supports multiple android smartphones
- the update rate is determined by the Android OS
